# ASP.NET SignalR JavaScript Client

This is the client for ASP.NET SignalR. Use this package **only** if you are connecting to an application written in ASP.NET (using System.Web, or OWIN self-host).

If you are connecting to an ASP.NET Core application, or building a serverless application that makes use of Azure SignalR Service,  use the [@microsoft/signalr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/signalr) package.
