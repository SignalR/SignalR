# ASP.NET SignalR [![Build Status](http://ci.signalr.net/app/rest/builds/buildType:\(id:bt2\)/statusIcon)](http://ci.signalr.net/?guest=1)
ASP.NET SignalR is a new library for ASP.NET developers that makes it incredibly simple to add real-time web functionality to your applications. What is "real-time web" functionality? It's the ability to have your server-side code push content to the connected clients as it happens, in real-time.

## What can it be used for?
Pushing data from the server to the client (not just browser clients) has always been a tough problem. SignalR makes 
it dead easy and handles all the heavy lifting for you.
