This repository hosts code and project management for ASP.NET SignalR, for use in .NET Framework applications using System.Web or Katana. If you are looking for information on ASP.NET Core SignalR, see the https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/tree/master/src/SignalR repository.

ASP.NET SignalR is a library for ASP.NET developers that makes it incredibly simple to add real-time web functionality to your applications. What is "real-time web" functionality? It's the ability to have your server-side code push content to the connected clients as it happens, in real-time.

## What can it be used for?
Pushing data from the server to the client (not just browser clients) has always been a tough problem. SignalR makes 
it dead easy and handles all the heavy lifting for you.
